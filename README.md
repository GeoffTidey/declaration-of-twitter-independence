# The Declaration of Twitter Independence

This is a declaration of independence by the Twitter Developer Community. Too many good apps have fallen victim to the tyrany and oppression of [the new Twitter policy changes](https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api) and it's time to take a stance against it. The signers of this document vow to avoid supporting Twitter as a developer platform until they adopt a more developer friendly policy. This includes directly boycotting any events that Twitter sponsors and not developing apps that consume their API. Show your support by forking and signing.
